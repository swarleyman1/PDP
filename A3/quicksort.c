// Parallel quicksort using MPI

/* 
Algorithm:
1 Divide the data into p equal parts, one per process
2 Sort the data locally for each process
3 Perform global sort
    3.1 Select pivot element within each process set
    3.2 Locally in each process, divide the data into two sets according to the
    pivot (smaller or larger)
    3.3 Split the processes into two groups and exchange data pairwise between
    them so that all processes in one group get data less than the pivot and
    the others get data larger than the pivot.
    3.4 Merge the two sets of numbers in each process into one sorted list
4 Repeat 3.1 - 3.4 recursively for each half until each
group consists of one single process.
